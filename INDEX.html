# Impact on global behaviours during Covid-19 pandemic

The objective of this study is to analyze the impact Covid-19 had on people's health and quality of life around the world since the pandemic started and how compliant they have been with COVID-19 safety measures. This analysis gives us an insight into how people have adapted and changed their behaviour as the situation has evolved.
The data for this study has been sourced from an ongoing global survey conducted by Imperial College London in partnership with YouGov,a global public opinion organisation.

Thailand, Saudi Arabia and UAE show a higher number of respondents testing themselves for COVID-19 compared to other countries, which is the key reason for the high percentage of people testing positive in these countries. 
While fewer respondents from countries like China, US, India are getting themselves tested when these countries had a significant rise in COVID-19 cases since April. This easily indicates that with fewer people testing, many infections are going undetected.
